This repo does not contain our current code for interacting with the
Simons Genome Diversity Project. That is in our "simons" repo, which is now
public. Please use that instead.

This repo contains the slurm scripts written by Nathan Harris that the
rogers lab used with data from the Simons Genome Diversity Project. The 
scripts download the data, filter it, and convert it into .raf format.

There are two subdirectories: "eur" deals with French and British samples;
"yri" deals with Yoruban samples.

The scripts don't run, because they refer to a file that is not in the
repo.
