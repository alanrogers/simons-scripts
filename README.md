This repo contains the slurm scripts (written by Nathan Harris) that the
rogers lab used with data from the Simons Genome Diversity Project. The 
scripts download the data, filter it, and convert it into .raf format.

There are two subdirectories: "eur" deals with French and British samples;
"yri" deals with Yoruban samples.
